# Deep Image Super-Resolution Network

This project is focused on improving the resolution of images using deep learning, specifically with convolutional neural networks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project and run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and PyTorch installed. You can download and install them from their respective websites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

### Running the Project

After cloning the project, navigate to the directory of the project on your local machine using a terminal or command prompt and run either PyTorch or Tensorflow version:

    python sup_res_torch.py
or

    python sup_res_tf.py
